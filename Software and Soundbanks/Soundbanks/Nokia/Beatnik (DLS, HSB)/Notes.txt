miniBAE banks:
- The HSB banks here are the uncompressed versions included in Nokia Audio Suite (except Idefix), although the compressed versions included on the phones may be added in the future. 
- The difference between the Mango bank and the alt version is that the alt version has some extra instruments, but does not include the vocoder samples used in ringtones like Vocoder and Robotic. It appears to have been an earlier internal revision of the bank. The alt Mango BSN also includes a set of ringtones and alerts from Beatnik.
- The Chippy BSN was found in the Nokia 3510 firmware. The alt Mango BSN was supplied to us by Markus Castrén. The remaining BSNs are fanmade recreations produced by reverse engineering the HSB soundbanks, but work well enough if you want to use them for creating music with the banks. 

mobileBAE/Series 30 engine banks:
- The Tongbao bank has two versions: one for Series 40 phones using mobileBAE, and one for Series 30 phones using Nokia's own sound engine. Although the S30 version shipped on phones before the S40 version, the S30 version features simplified ADSR and optimized samples due to the limitations of the sound engine and Series 30.
- Currently no Nokia 2300 bank is available. This uses a few drum samples, but most of the instruments are software-based synth patches.
